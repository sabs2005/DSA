Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

Why did I use the data structure?
Algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n). Binary search has this timecomplexity.


Time complexity:  O(log(n)) as binary search has that time complexity
	rotated_array_search :O(log(n)) n is the number of input list items
	linear_search: O(n) n is the number of input list items
	
Space complexity: O(1) binary search does not use any additional space.
