Rearrange Array Elements

Why did I use the data structure?
The expected time complexity is O(nlog(n)). Merge sort has this timecomplexity.


Time complexity:  O(nlog(n)) 
	mergesort():  O(nlog(n)) n= number of comparisons per step.
		    logn = the number steps
Space complexity: O(n)
	merge(): O(n) 
	mergesort()using recursion: O(logn)
