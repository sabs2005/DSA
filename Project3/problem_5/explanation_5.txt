Autocomplete with Tries

Why did I use the data structure?
Trie is the right option to use when storing a dynamic set of strings.

Time complexity: O(nl)
	suffixes():  O(nl) n=num of words, l=letters in each word 
	insert(): O(n) n is characters in the inserted word
	find(): O(n) n is all keys under root
      
Space complexity: O(nls)
	suffixes(): O(nls) s = space taken by each letter of each word
	insert(): O(n) n is characters in the inserted word
	find(): O(1) no change to initial space used
