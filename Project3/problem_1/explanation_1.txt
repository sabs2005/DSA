Square root of an integer

Why did I use the data structure?
Binary search has a time complexity of log(n).The expected time complexity is O(log(n))


Time complexity: O(log(n)) as binary search has that time complexity.
		n is the input number.
Space complexity: O(1) binary search does not use any additional space.
